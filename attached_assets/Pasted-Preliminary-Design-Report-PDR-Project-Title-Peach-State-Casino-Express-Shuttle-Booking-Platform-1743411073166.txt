Preliminary Design Report (PDR)
Project Title:
Peach State Casino Express – Shuttle Booking Platform

Client:
Peach State Casino Express
Target Audience: Active Adults 55+ in Georgia & North Carolina
Target Launch Date: May 15, 2025

1. Project Overview
Peach State Casino Express seeks a custom-built, mobile-friendly shuttle reservation system to serve multiple 55+ communities. Each property will be assigned a unique QR code leading to its own branded booking page. The platform must support trip reservations, payment processing, seat caps, and administrative tools such as manifests and live dashboards — all designed with simplicity and scalability in mind.

2. Objectives
Allow residents from different properties to book seats via property-specific QR code landing pages.

Cap each trip at 30 paid riders, generate driver manifests, and automate payment handling via Stripe.

Deliver a system that is intuitive, scalable, and user-friendly for seniors, with a clean UI, large fonts, and mobile-first design.

Ensure the platform is fully owned and hosted by the client, with no recurring software fees beyond payment processing.
